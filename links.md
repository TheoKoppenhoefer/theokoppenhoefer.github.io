Links to the [report](https://github.com/TheoKoppenhoefer/numerics-seminar-VT23/blob/main/Report/Report_TheoKoppenhoefer.pdf), [presentation](https://github.com/TheoKoppenhoefer/numerics-seminar-VT23/blob/main/Presentation/Presentation_TheoKoppenhoefer.pdf) and [implementation](https://github.com/TheoKoppenhoefer/numerics-seminar-VT23) |
| Simulation Tools, Lund, VT23| Three projects with a joint [report](Report/Report_SalvadorTheo.pdf) by me and [Salvador Castagnino](https://github.com/salvaCasta276) |
| Computational Science, Lund, HT23| This consisted of three group projects whose implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/TheoKoppenhoefer/computational-science-HT23/blob/main/Project1/Report_Theo/Report/Report_TheoKoppenhoefer.pdf). There also are reports for the [first](https://github.com/TheoKoppenhoefer/computational-science-HT23/blob/main/Project1/Report_Theo/Report/Report_TheoKoppenhoefer.pdf), [second](https://github.com/TheoKoppenhoefer/computational-science-HT23/blob/main/Project2/Report_Theo/Report_TheoKoppenhoefer.pdf) and [third](https://github.com/TheoKoppenhoefer/computational-science-HT23/blob/main/Project3/Report_Theo/Report_TheoKoppenhoefer.pdf) projects. |
| Integration theory, Lund, VT23|  The project was to present the integral presented in the paper “Henstock-Kurzweil integral on BV sets” (2016) by Malý and Pfeffer. It includes a project [presentation](https://github.com/TheoKoppenhoefer/integration-theory-VT23/blob/main/Presentation/Presentation_TheoKoppenhoefer.pdf) and an [essay](https://github.com/TheoKoppenhoefer/integration-theory-VT23/blob/main/Report/Essay_TheoKoppenhoefer.pdf)|
