Currently I am a mathematics student at Lund university. In fall 2024 I will start a PhD at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh. You may find that I like maths. More specifically I focus on analysis of partial differential equations and numerical analysis though you may find that I have taken courses all over the shop in mathematics (and some physics).
I also like reading. A lot. Besides of that I regularly go out for hikes and cycle rides in the surrounding nature.
Below you may find an abbreviated CV of me. You may also find this abbreviated CV in [pdf](/assets/CV/CV_TheoKoppenhoefer.pdf) format.
Feel free to [contact](/contact/) me if you have any question, suggestions or remarks.
