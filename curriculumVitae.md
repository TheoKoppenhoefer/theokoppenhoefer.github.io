Currently I am a mathematics student at Lund university. Below you may find an abbreviated CV of me. You may find that I like maths. More specifically I focus on analysis of partial differential equations and numerical analysis though you may find that I have taken courses all over the shop in mathematics (and some physics).
I also like reading. A lot. Besides of that I regularly go out for hikes and cycle rides in the surrounding nature. Feel free to [contact](/contact/) me if you have any question, suggestions or remarks.
