Currently I am a PhD student at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh.
You may find that I like maths. More specifically I focus on analysis of partial differential equations and more specifically water waves under the supervision
of [Daniel Coutand](https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/daniel-coutand/)
and [Beatrice Pelloni](https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/beatrice-pelloni/).
During my bachelors I also focused on numerical analysis though I have taken courses all over the shop in mathematics (and some physics).
As a result of a summer project in 2024 I am one of the co-founders of [kravianalytics](https://www.kravianalytics.com/).
When I find the time I enjoy reading. A lot. Besides of that I regularly go out for hikes and cycle rides in the surrounding nature.
Below you may find an abbreviated CV of me. You may also find this abbreviated CV in [pdf](/assets/CV/CV_TheoKoppenhoefer.pdf) format.
Feel free to [contact](/contact/) me if you have any question, suggestions or remarks.
